# OCR Magic Card Reader

This is a Python script that uses EasyOCR to perform optical character recognition (OCR) on images of Magic cards. It extracts text from the images and optionally saves the results to a CSV file. It also provides options for displaying the annotated images and monitoring progress.

# TODO
- Rewrite arguments section of README.
- Add set recognition & detection, (If anyone could help with this that'd be great) Just create a pull request!
